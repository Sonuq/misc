Stuff that doesn't really deserver a repository.


1. Internet Reset, I don't really see a purpose for this unless you have people in your home and you want to mess with them. You will need the Access-Code of the router
and you must do a reset using the access-code and then get the cookie. ( I don't plan on updating for now ) 

2. Nut, just some weird stuff I did, I still haven't finished it nor I plan too
